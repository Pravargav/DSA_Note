#### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree#:~:text=A%20minimum%20spanning%20tree%20(MST)%20or%20minimum,minimum%20spanning%20trees%20for%20its%20connected%20components.)

A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** or **minimum weight spanning tree** is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge‑weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.[1]

That is, it is a **spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible**.[2]

More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a **minimum spanning forest**, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.
