**scc1->scc2** - can happen.

**scc1->scc2 and scc2->scc1** - can never happen because if it's in both directions it will form a **scc12** as a whole.

**scc1->scc2, scc1->scc2, scc1->scc2** - possible beacause there can be any number of directed edges from one scc to another in a single direction.
