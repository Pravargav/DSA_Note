-> abstraction and encapsulation is same hiding

Feature      	       Encapsulation	                          Abstraction

Purpose         	{Hides internal data via access control}   	{Hides implementation complexity}

Focus	           {Data protection and access control}	      {Interface design and implementation hiding}

How it's achieved  {Access modifiers (private, public)}   	    {Abstract classes, interfaces}

-> polymorphism and inheritance same  use extends
